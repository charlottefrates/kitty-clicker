# Kitty Clicker 🐱
![Part of the Udacity Front-End Web Development Nanodegree](https://img.shields.io/badge/Udacity-Front--End%20Web%20Developer%20Nanodegree-02b3e4.svg)

A small project done alongside Udacity's "JavaScript Design Patterns" course. 

It wasn't needed for a grade in the program, but the course did work better if I did the work alongside the lessons. 📈

## How it works

1. Click a cat's name up top. 
2. Click the picture of the cat. 😸

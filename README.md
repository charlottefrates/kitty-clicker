# Kitty Clicker
![Part of the Udacity Front-End Web Development Nanodegree](https://img.shields.io/badge/Udacity-Front--End%20Web%20Developer%20Nanodegree-02b3e4.svg)

A small project done alongside Udacity's "JavaScript Design Patterns" course. It wasn't needed for a grade in the program, but the course did work better if I did the work alongside the lessons.

## How it works

1. Click a Cat's name up top
2. Click the Picture of the cat
3. Watch the number go up!

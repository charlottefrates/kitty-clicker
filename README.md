# Kitty Clicker 🐱
![Part of the Udacity Front-End Web Development Nanodegree](https://img.shields.io/badge/Udacity-Front--End%20Web%20Developer%20Nanodegree-02b3e4.svg) 🎓

A small project done alongside Udacity's "JavaScript Design Patterns" course. It wasn't needed for a grade in the program, but the course did work better if I did the work alongside the lessons. 📈

A simple game, in the vein of "clicker" games like cookie clicker and cow clicker, where you tap on items and make the numbers go up for little reason beyond making the numbers go up. This time, with kitties.

## How it works

1. Click a cat's name up top. ㊔
2. Click the picture of the cat. 😸
3. Watch the kitty's number go up! 💯
